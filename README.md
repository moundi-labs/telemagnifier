# telemagnifier

### Background
Traditional Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions differ significantly from real-world security environments due to the absence of internal monitoring systems. This allows participants to freely use attack techniques that would be easily detected in production environments.   
Telemagnifier bridges this gap by introducing a realistic security monitoring platform designed specifically for competitive hacking scenarios. By incorporating detection techniques used in actual enterprise environments, it encourages participants to develop stealthy and sophisticated attack methodologies.

### Features
- Real-time eBPF Monitoring: Advanced system-level monitoring using eBPF technology to detect attack techniques and suspicious activities in real-time, mimicking enterprise security environments
<!--
- Multi-Environment Support: Compatible with various deployment environments including Virtual Machines (VM) and Kubernetes clusters to simulate diverse production scenarios
- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Supports multiple operating systems including Linux and Windows for comprehensive attack surface coverage
- Rule-based Detection Engine: Customizable detection rules that mirror real-world enterprise security monitoring, forcing attackers to develop evasion techniques
- CTF-Optimized Design: Purpose-built for competitive hacking scenarios with realistic security controls that challenge participants beyond traditional CTF environments
- Enterprise-Grade Detection: Incorporates actual production monitoring techniques to bridge the gap between CTF competitions and real-world penetration testing
- Stealth Challenge Framework: Encourages development of sophisticated, low-profile attack methodologies by implementing detection mechanisms commonly found in corporate environments
