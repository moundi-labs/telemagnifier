### Background
Traditional Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions differ significantly from real-world security environments due to the absence of internal monitoring systems. This allows participants to freely use attack techniques that would be easily detected in production environments.   
Telemagnifier bridges this gap by introducing a realistic security monitoring platform designed specifically for competitive hacking scenarios. By incorporating detection techniques used in actual enterprise environments, it encourages participants to develop stealthy and sophisticated attack methodologies.
